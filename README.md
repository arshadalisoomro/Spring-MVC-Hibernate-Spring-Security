# Spring-MVC-Hibernate-Spring-Security and Thymleaf with mysql
To set up this project just clone it
import it to your favourit IDE
open src/main/resources
There will be a file named script which actually a mysql script for creating the tables. Just run that sql file and you will have a working project with token based authentication.

Thanks
